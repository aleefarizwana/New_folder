PROJECT NAME : CAR DEALER
PROBLEM:
A Car dealer wants to automate the billing process of cars based on the car selected. The
customer has the options to choose below.
Car Model Cost(Showroom price)
Polo Trendline 8.70 lakh
Polo Highline 10.09 lakh
Virtus Trendline 11.05 lakh
Virtus Highline 13.08 lakh
Taigun Trendline 14.89 lakh
Taigun Highline 15.42 lakh
Taigun Topline 17.71 lakh
Once the customer has selected the car, additional taxes and fees has to be paid as given
below
Fee type Cost
RTO 1,13,990
Insurance 47,300
TCS charges 11,000
Additional Accessories 15,000
In the additional section customers have an option to opt out for insurance and additional
accessories.
The car dealer has an option to give a discount either in percentage or in rupees(Dealer
discount has to be applied on the showroom price). Car dealer can apply discount only if the
customer opts in for either insurance or additional accessories and cannot cross 30,000.
There should be an error saying maximum discount to be applied should not cross 30,000 and
only apply 30,000 as discount.
If the customer doesnâ€™t opt-in for insurance or additional accessories and if the dealer tries to
add a discount it should show an error saying any one of the additional features have to be
added and 0 discount has to be added.
After selecting car and opt in options the total amount to be paid has to be displayed
